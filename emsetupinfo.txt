 NOTE:
 An encryption key has been generated to encrypt sensitive data in the Management Repository. If this key is lost, all encrypted data in the Repository becomes unusable. 

 A backup of the OMS configuration is available in /u01/app/oracle/middleware/gc_inst/em/EMGC_OMS1/sysman/backup on host workshop.oracle.com. See Cloud Control Administrators Guide for details on how to back up and recover an OMS.

 NOTE: This backup is valid only for the initial OMS configuration. For example, it will not reflect plug-ins installed later, topology changes like the addition of a load balancer, or changes to other properties made using emctl or emcli. Backups should be created on a regular basis to ensure they capture the current OMS configuration. Use the following command to backup the OMS configuration:
/u01/app/oracle/middleware/12.1.0.4/oms/bin/emctl exportconfig oms -dir <backup dir>
